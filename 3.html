		<li><ul><h1>Python is an open-source programming language used by software engineers and back-end Web developers. Python is well-suited for scientific computing, and it is relatively simple to learn.</h1>
			
		</ul></li>
		<li><ul><h1>Java is prevalent in Web-based development, and it was created in 1995. Many companies in the health sciences, education, and finance industries use Java. Java enables the downloading of applets from websites, which enable browsers to perform additional functions.</h1>
			
		</ul></li>
		<li><ul><h1>Ruby is an open-source scripting language that coders can use independently or in conjunction with Ruby on Rails. NASA uses Ruby in its work with simulations.</h1>
			
		</ul></li>
		<li><ul><h1>HTML is used extensively in Web development. HTML is the code that serves as the foundation of Web pages, allowing people to create and structure electronic documents for viewing online.</h1>
			
		</ul></li>
		<li><ul><h1>JavaScript is used by Web developers and software engineers to manipulate page elements to make them more engaging. JavaScript enhances HTML, and it is embedded in most Internet browsers.</h1>
			
		</ul></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><ul><h1>C is a middle-level programming language used by software developers and systems analysts. Programmers use C to create applications that integrate with operating systems.</h1>
			</ul></li>
		<li><ul><h1>C++, developed in 1983, is another middle-level programming language and works as an extension of C. Programmers use C++ to create games, graphics, and office applications.</h1>
			</ul></li>
		<li><ul><h1>C# is a programming language used by software engineers who create applications designed to work with Windows operating systems. C# shares similarities with Java.</h1>
			</ul></li>
		<li><ul><h1>SQL enables programmers to create, read, update, and delete information in a database. Companies use SQL to gather data.</h1>
